# Pandas Best Practices Demonstration

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Pandas_1.ipynb`, which is designed to showcase some of the best practices in using the pandas library in Python. The notebook explores various techniques with the aim of providing a practical guide to writing clean, memory efficient, and maintainable Python code.

## Course Session Application

Please note that the content of this notebook is an application of a course session. The code and techniques demonstrated may be similar to those found in other resources or online code examples. The purpose of this notebook is to provide a consolidated, practical guide to pandas best practices for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this notebook, clone the repository and open `Pandas_1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Create a virtual environment:

    For Windows:
    ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now, you are ready to run the project.

## Using GitHub Codespaces

If you prefer to work online, you can use GitHub Codespaces. This service provides a complete, configurable dev environment on top of a powerful VM in minutes, and you can use it directly within GitHub.

Please note that the setup might be slightly different in Codespaces. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) for detailed instructions on how to set up and use a codespace.
